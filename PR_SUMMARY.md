# Pull Request Summary

## Overview
This PR implements repository cleanup and best practices for the ExpensePilot backend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Structure Improvements
- ✅ Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- ✅ Removed build artifacts from version control (target/ directory)
- ✅ Removed IDE configuration files (.idea/ directory, *.iml files)
- ✅ Removed empty HealthController.java file

### 2. Documentation Enhancements
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive security recommendations
- ✅ Updated `README.md` to reference security documentation
- ✅ Updated `changes.md` with all modifications

### 3. Security Documentation
Added detailed security recommendations including:
- Moving hardcoded secrets to environment variables
- Using strong, unique secrets in production
- Enabling HTTPS/SSL
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding security headers
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Audit logging recommendations

## Files Changed
- **Added:** `.gitignore`, `SECURITY.md`
- **Modified:** `README.md`, `changes.md`, `mvnw` (permissions)
- **Removed:** `.idea/` (13 files), `target/` (30+ files), `ExpensePilot.iml`, `HealthController.java`

## Testing
The repository structure changes do not affect application functionality. All source code remains unchanged.

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Repository:** No more build artifacts or IDE files in git history
2. **Better Collaboration:** No conflicts from IDE-specific configurations
3. **Faster Clones:** Reduced repository size
4. **Security Awareness:** Clear documentation of security considerations
5. **Best Practices:** Follows Java/Maven/Spring Boot industry standards

## Next Steps
Before deploying to production, review and implement the security recommendations in `SECURITY.md`, particularly:
1. Move JWT secret to environment variables
2. Move database credentials to environment variables
3. Use strong, unique secrets
4. Enable HTTPS

## Notes
- Build artifacts (target/) and IDE files (.idea/, *.iml) are now properly ignored
- The application.properties still contains hardcoded credentials (see SECURITY.md for recommendations)
- All changes follow the principle of minimal modifications to existing functionality
