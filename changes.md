# Changes Made to ExpensePilot Spring Boot Project

## 1. Fixed Compilation Errors in ExpenseController.java
- Completed the `updateExpense` method by adding missing return statements and closing braces.
- Removed invalid commented code inside the class that could cause compilation issues.

## 2. Dockerfile Build Process Explained
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build:
  1. **Build Stage**: Uses a Maven image to run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and build your Spring Boot JAR.
  2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses an OpenJDK image to run the built JAR file.
- This process ensures your application is compiled and packaged before being deployed in a lightweight Java runtime container.

## 3. Port Binding for Render.com
- Updated `application.properties` to use `server.port=${PORT:8080}` so the app listens on the port provided by Render.

## 4. Health Check Endpoint
- Added `/api/health` endpoint in `ExpenseController.java` that returns HTTP 200 OK for Render health checks.

## 5. Dockerfile Improvements
- Verified `EXPOSE 8080` is present.
- Added `CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]` to ensure the container runs the Spring Boot JAR file.

## 6. Next Steps
- The project should now compile successfully. If you run `mvn clean package` or build with Docker, the errors should be resolved.
- If further errors occur, check for similar syntax issues in other files.
- Redeploy to Render.com. The app should now start correctly and respond to health checks, resolving the 502 Bad Gateway error.
- If you use a database in production, update datasource settings accordingly.

## 7. Whitelabel Error Page (404 Not Found)
- After deployment, accessing the root URL `/` returns a Whitelabel Error Page (404 Not Found).
- This is because there is no explicit mapping for `/` in the controller. The greeting endpoint is mapped to `/api/`.
- To resolve this, added a root endpoint (`@GetMapping("/")`) in `ExpenseController.java` that returns a simple greeting message, so the root URL responds with HTTP 200 and a message instead of a 404 error.

## 8. Root Whitelabel Error Page (404 Not Found)
- Issue: Visiting `/` in the browser returned a Whitelabel Error Page because all endpoints in `ExpenseController` are prefixed with `/api` due to `@RequestMapping("/api")`.
- Solution: Created a new `RootController.java` with a `@GetMapping("/")` endpoint to handle root requests and return a simple message. This ensures the root URL (`/`) responds with HTTP 200 and a message instead of a 404 error.
- This keeps API endpoints under `/api` and the root endpoint separate for clarity.

## 9. Custom Error Controller Implementation
- Issue: The application showed "This application has no explicit mapping for /error" in the Whitelabel Error Page.
- Solution: Created `CustomErrorController.java` that implements Spring Boot's `ErrorController` interface to handle all error scenarios properly.
- This controller provides custom error messages for different HTTP status codes (404, 500, etc.) instead of the default Whitelabel Error Page.
- The `/error` endpoint now returns meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes.

## 10. Enhanced Root Controller
- Updated `RootController.java` to include a `/status` endpoint for additional health checking.
- Improved the root endpoint message to inform users about API endpoints being available at `/api/`.
- Removed conflicting root endpoint from `ExpenseController.java` to prevent mapping conflicts.

## 11. Controller Conflict Resolution
- Removed the duplicate root endpoint method that was incorrectly added to `ExpenseController.java`.
- Ensured only one controller (`RootController`) handles the root path (`/`) to avoid Spring Boot mapping conflicts.
- Kept API endpoints properly organized under `/api` prefix in `ExpenseController`.

## 12. Fixed Spring Boot 3.x Compilation Errors in CustomErrorController
- Issue: Build failed with compilation errors - `package javax.servlet.http does not exist` and `cannot find symbol: class HttpServletRequest`.
- Root Cause: Spring Boot 3.x uses `jakarta.servlet` instead of `javax.servlet` (migration from Java EE to Jakarta EE).
- Solution: Updated `CustomErrorController.java` imports:
  - Changed `import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;` to `import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;`
  - Updated servlet error attribute names from `javax.servlet.error.*` to `jakarta.servlet.error.*`
- This ensures compatibility with Spring Boot 3.5.5 and resolves the Maven build compilation failure.

## 13. Jakarta EE Migration Compatibility
- Spring Boot 3.x requires Jakarta EE instead of Java EE namespace.
- All servlet-related imports must use `jakarta.*` instead of `javax.*` packages.
- This is a breaking change when upgrading from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x.
- The fix ensures the application builds successfully in Docker and deploys correctly on Render.com.
